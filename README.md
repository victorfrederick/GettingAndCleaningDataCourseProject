Given Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometer data the run_analysis.R script 
will perform the following:
1. Download the dataset and unzip it.
2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names by turning activities
and subjects columns into factors.
5. Finally, it will create an independent tidy data set.
